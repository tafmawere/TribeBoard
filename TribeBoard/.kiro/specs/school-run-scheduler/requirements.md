# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The School Run Scheduler feature provides a comprehensive multi-screen system for creating, managing, and executing structured school runs within the TribeBoard family coordination app. This is a UX-focused implementation that enables parents to schedule runs with multiple stops, assign children to specific stops, track tasks, and execute runs step-by-step. The feature uses placeholder data for maps and real-time updates while maintaining consistency with TribeBoard's existing design system and branding.
