# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds a floating bottom navigation menu to the TribeBoard app's dashboard screen. The navigation menu will provide quick access to the four main sections of the app: Home (Dashboard), School Run, Shopping, and Tasks. The floating design will enhance the user experience by providing persistent navigation while maintaining the visual appeal of the current UI design.
