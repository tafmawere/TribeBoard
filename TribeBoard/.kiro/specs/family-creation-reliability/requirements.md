# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The family creation feature is experiencing reliability issues with EXC_BREAKPOINT errors occurring during the unique code generation process. Users are unable to successfully create families due to crashes in the DataService.fetchFamily(byCode:) method. This feature needs to be made more robust with proper error handling, fallback mechanisms, and improved code generation logic to ensure reliable family creation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user creating a family, I want the family creation process to complete successfully without crashes, so that I can set up my family board and invite members.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user initiates family creation THEN the system SHALL complete the process without throwing EXC_BREAKPOINT errors
2. WHEN the unique code generation encounters an error THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff up to 3 times
3. WHEN all retry attempts fail THEN the system SHALL provide a meaningful error message to the user
4. WHEN family creation succeeds THEN the system SHALL generate a QR code and navigate to the family dashboard

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to generate truly unique family codes reliably, so that there are no conflicts when joining families.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating a family code THEN the system SHALL check both local storage and CloudKit for uniqueness
2. WHEN a code collision is detected THEN the system SHALL generate a new code automatically
3. WHEN CloudKit is unavailable THEN the system SHALL fall back to local-only uniqueness checking
4. WHEN the maximum retry limit is reached THEN the system SHALL throw a specific error indicating code generation failure

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want robust error handling throughout the family creation flow, so that I can diagnose and fix issues quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any step in family creation fails THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information
2. WHEN CloudKit operations fail THEN the system SHALL distinguish between network errors and data errors
3. WHEN local database operations fail THEN the system SHALL provide specific error context
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL clean up any partially created data

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the family creation process to work offline or with poor network connectivity, so that I can create families regardless of network conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN network connectivity is poor THEN the system SHALL create the family locally and sync later
2. WHEN CloudKit is unavailable THEN the system SHALL mark records for later sync
3. WHEN offline mode is detected THEN the system SHALL inform the user about sync status
4. WHEN connectivity is restored THEN the system SHALL automatically sync pending records

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear feedback during the family creation process, so that I understand what's happening and can take appropriate action if issues occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN family creation starts THEN the system SHALL show a loading indicator
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages
3. WHEN network issues are detected THEN the system SHALL inform the user about connectivity problems
4. WHEN family creation succeeds THEN the system SHALL show a success message and navigate appropriately
