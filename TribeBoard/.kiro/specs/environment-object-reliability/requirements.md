# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The TribeBoard app is experiencing crashes due to missing environment objects in the school run scheduler views. The crash occurs when `ScheduledRunsListView` attempts to access an `AppState` environment object that hasn't been properly injected into the view hierarchy. This creates a critical reliability issue that prevents users from accessing the scheduled runs functionality.

## Requirementso

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the scheduled runs list to load without crashing, so that I can view and manage my school runs reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the ScheduledRunsListView is displayed THEN the app SHALL NOT crash due to missing environment objects
2. WHEN the view needs to access AppState THEN the system SHALL provide a valid AppState instance or graceful fallback
3. WHEN navigation actions are triggered THEN the system SHALL handle them without throwing environment object errors
4. WHEN the view is used in previews THEN the system SHALL provide mock environment objects automatically

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want environment object dependencies to be clearly managed and testable, so that I can prevent similar crashes in the future.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a view requires environment objects THEN the system SHALL provide clear dependency injection patterns
2. WHEN environment objects are missing THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error handling or fallbacks
3. WHEN writing tests THEN the system SHALL allow easy mocking of environment dependencies
4. WHEN creating previews THEN the system SHALL automatically provide required environment objects

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want consistent navigation behavior across all school run views, so that the app feels reliable and predictable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I tap navigation buttons THEN the system SHALL consistently navigate to the correct destination
2. WHEN navigation fails THEN the system SHALL provide user-friendly error feedback
3. WHEN using the app in different contexts THEN navigation SHALL work consistently across all entry points
4. WHEN the app recovers from errors THEN navigation state SHALL be properly restored

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want robust error handling for environment object issues, so that the app can gracefully handle missing dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN environment objects are missing THEN the system SHALL log appropriate error information
2. WHEN fallback behavior is needed THEN the system SHALL provide sensible defaults
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL prevent cascading failures
4. WHEN debugging THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages indicating missing dependencies
