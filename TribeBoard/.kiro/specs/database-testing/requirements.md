# Database Testing Requirements

## Introduction

This specification defines comprehensive testing requirements for the TribeBoard database system, which uses SwiftData for local storage with CloudKit synchronization. The testing framework needs to validate data integrity, relationships, synchronization, performance, and error handling across the entire data layer.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Core Data Model Testing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive model validation testing so that I can ensure data integrity and business rules are enforced at the model level.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a Family model THEN the system SHALL validate name length (2-50 characters)
2. WHEN creating a Family model THEN the system SHALL validate code format (6-8 alphanumeric characters)
3. WHEN creating a UserProfile model THEN the system SHALL validate display name (1-50 characters, non-empty)
4. WHEN creating a UserProfile model THEN the system SHALL validate Apple ID hash (minimum 10 characters)
5. WHEN creating a Membership model THEN the system SHALL validate family and user relationships exist
6. WHEN checking Family.hasParentAdmin THEN the system SHALL return true only if an active parent admin membership exists
7. WHEN accessing Family.activeMembers THEN the system SHALL return only memberships with status 'active'

### Requirement 2: Database Container and Context Testing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to test ModelContainer creation and configuration so that I can ensure the database initializes correctly in all environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating ModelContainer with CloudKit THEN the system SHALL successfully initialize with CloudKit configuration
2. WHEN CloudKit is unavailable THEN the system SHALL fallback to local-only storage
3. WHEN all container creation fails THEN the system SHALL create in-memory container as last resort
4. WHEN validating schema THEN the system SHALL verify all model relationships are properly configured
5. WHEN ModelContext is created THEN the system SHALL be able to perform basic CRUD operations
6. WHEN testing in-memory container THEN the system SHALL not persist data between test runs

### Requirement 3: Data Service CRUD Operations Testing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive testing of DataService operations so that I can ensure all database operations work correctly with proper validation and error handling.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a family THEN the system SHALL validate input data and enforce unique code constraint
2. WHEN fetching family by code THEN the system SHALL return the correct family or null if not found
3. WHEN creating user profile THEN the system SHALL validate display name and Apple ID hash
4. WHEN creating membership THEN the system SHALL enforce parent admin uniqueness constraint
5. WHEN creating duplicate membership THEN the system SHALL throw constraint violation error
6. WHEN updating membership role THEN the system SHALL validate role change rules
7. WHEN removing membership THEN the system SHALL soft delete (set status to removed)
8. WHEN generating unique family code THEN the system SHALL ensure no collisions with existing codes

### Requirement 4: CloudKit Synchronization Testing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to test CloudKit synchronization functionality so that I can ensure data syncs correctly between devices and handles conflicts appropriately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN converting model to CKRecord THEN the system SHALL include all required fields with correct types
2. WHEN updating model from CKRecord THEN the system SHALL correctly map all CloudKit fields to model properties
3. WHEN resolving sync conflicts THEN the system SHALL use last-write-wins strategy based on modification dates
4. WHEN marking record as synced THEN the system SHALL update needsSync flag and lastSyncDate
5. WHEN CloudKit is unavailable THEN the system SHALL queue changes for later sync
6. WHEN handling CloudKit errors THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate retry logic with exponential backoff
7. WHEN setting up CloudKit subscriptions THEN the system SHALL create subscriptions for all model types

### Requirement 5: Relationship and Constraint Testing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to test all model relationships and business constraints so that I can ensure data consistency and referential integrity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN family is deleted THEN the system SHALL cascade delete all associated memberships
2. WHEN user is deleted THEN the system SHALL cascade delete all associated memberships
3. WHEN creating second parent admin THEN the system SHALL reject with constraint violation error
4. WHEN user joins family they're already member of THEN the system SHALL reject with constraint violation error
5. WHEN changing role to parent admin THEN the system SHALL validate no existing parent admin exists
6. WHEN fetching family memberships THEN the system SHALL return all memberships with correct relationships
7. WHEN accessing membership.family THEN the system SHALL return the associated family object

### Requirement 6: Validation and Error Handling Testing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive validation and error handling tests so that I can ensure the system gracefully handles invalid data and edge cases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN providing invalid family name THEN the system SHALL return specific validation error message
2. WHEN providing invalid family code THEN the system SHALL return specific validation error message
3. WHEN providing empty display name THEN the system SHALL return validation error
4. WHEN providing short Apple ID hash THEN the system SHALL return validation error
5. WHEN database operation fails THEN the system SHALL wrap error with appropriate DataServiceError type
6. WHEN CloudKit operation fails THEN the system SHALL wrap error with appropriate CloudKitError type
7. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide actionable error messages

### Requirement 7: Performance and Load Testing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want performance tests for database operations so that I can ensure the system performs well under load and with large datasets.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating 100 families THEN the system SHALL complete within reasonable time limits
2. WHEN fetching all families THEN the system SHALL return results efficiently regardless of dataset size
3. WHEN performing batch operations THEN the system SHALL be more efficient than individual operations
4. WHEN querying with predicates THEN the system SHALL use efficient query execution
5. WHEN syncing large datasets THEN the system SHALL handle CloudKit batch limits appropriately
6. WHEN running concurrent operations THEN the system SHALL maintain data consistency
7. WHEN memory usage is measured THEN the system SHALL not have significant memory leaks

### Requirement 8: Integration and End-to-End Testing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want integration tests that cover complete user workflows so that I can ensure all components work together correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user creates family THEN the complete flow SHALL create family, membership, and QR code successfully
2. WHEN user joins family THEN the complete flow SHALL find family, validate code, and create membership
3. WHEN managing roles THEN the complete flow SHALL validate constraints and update relationships
4. WHEN syncing to CloudKit THEN the complete flow SHALL handle conversion, upload, and conflict resolution
5. WHEN handling offline scenarios THEN the system SHALL queue operations and sync when online
6. WHEN app launches THEN the system SHALL initialize database and perform any necessary migrations
7. WHEN multiple users interact THEN the system SHALL maintain consistency across all operations

### Requirement 9: Mock and Test Environment Setup

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper test environment setup and mocking capabilities so that I can run tests reliably without external dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL use in-memory database that doesn't persist between tests
2. WHEN testing CloudKit operations THEN the system SHALL provide mock CloudKit services for unit tests
3. WHEN testing network operations THEN the system SHALL simulate various network conditions
4. WHEN testing error scenarios THEN the system SHALL provide controllable error injection
5. WHEN running test suite THEN the system SHALL clean up all test data between tests
6. WHEN testing async operations THEN the system SHALL properly handle async/await patterns
7. WHEN testing UI integration THEN the system SHALL provide test data generation utilities

### Requirement 10: Schema Migration and Versioning Testing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to test database schema changes and migrations so that I can ensure data is preserved during app updates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN schema version changes THEN the system SHALL migrate existing data correctly
2. WHEN adding new model properties THEN the system SHALL handle existing records appropriately
3. WHEN removing model properties THEN the system SHALL not break existing functionality
4. WHEN changing relationship configurations THEN the system SHALL maintain data integrity
5. WHEN CloudKit schema changes THEN the system SHALL handle server-side schema updates
6. WHEN migration fails THEN the system SHALL provide recovery mechanisms
7. WHEN testing migrations THEN the system SHALL validate data before and after migration
