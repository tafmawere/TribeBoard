# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a complete UI/UX prototype branch of the TribeBoard app that focuses purely on user interface, navigation flows, and visual design without any backend dependencies. The prototype will serve as a demo-ready version that showcases the complete user experience using mock data and stubs, allowing stakeholders to evaluate the app's design and user flows before full backend integration.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a stakeholder, I want to see a complete navigable prototype of the TribeBoard app, so that I can evaluate the user experience and design without waiting for backend implementation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the prototype app is launched THEN the system SHALL display a fully functional onboarding flow with no crashes
2. WHEN any navigation button is tapped THEN the system SHALL navigate to the appropriate screen with smooth transitions
3. WHEN the app is used offline THEN the system SHALL function completely using mock data without any service dependencies
4. WHEN forms are filled out THEN the system SHALL show appropriate validation states and feedback using mock responses

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to experience the complete onboarding and authentication flow, so that I can understand how to get started with the app.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the onboarding screen loads THEN the system SHALL display the TribeBoard logo, tagline, and sign-in options (Apple, Google placeholders)
2. WHEN sign-in buttons are tapped THEN the system SHALL show mock authentication success and navigate to family setup
3. WHEN Terms of Service or Privacy Policy links are tapped THEN the system SHALL display placeholder screens indicating these features
4. WHEN authentication is complete THEN the system SHALL transition smoothly to the family selection screen

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to set up or join a family through an intuitive interface, so that I can understand the family creation process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the family selection screen loads THEN the system SHALL display "Create Family" and "Join Family" options clearly
2. WHEN "Create Family" is selected THEN the system SHALL show a form with family name input and mock QR code generation
3. WHEN "Join Family" is selected THEN the system SHALL show code entry field and QR scan placeholder interface
4. WHEN family setup is completed THEN the system SHALL generate mock family codes and navigate to role selection
5. WHEN QR codes are displayed THEN the system SHALL show a dummy code that appears realistic for demonstration

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to select my role within the family, so that I can understand how role-based access works.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the role selection screen loads THEN the system SHALL display predefined mock roles (Parent, Child, Guardian, Driver, Admin)
2. WHEN a role is selected THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback and role description
3. WHEN role selection is confirmed THEN the system SHALL navigate to the family dashboard with role-appropriate interface
4. WHEN roles are displayed THEN the system SHALL show clear descriptions and permissions for each role

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a family member, I want to access a comprehensive dashboard, so that I can see all family information and available features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the dashboard loads THEN the system SHALL display family name, logo/avatar, and member list with dummy data
2. WHEN the member list is viewed THEN the system SHALL show 2-3 sample members with avatars and roles
3. WHEN quick actions are displayed THEN the system SHALL show "Add Member", "Assign Role", and "Settings" buttons
4. WHEN quick action buttons are tapped THEN the system SHALL navigate to appropriate mock screens
5. WHEN the dashboard is accessed THEN the system SHALL use placeholder data like "Mawere Family" as the family name

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a family member, I want to access various family management modules, so that I can understand the full scope of app functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the calendar module is accessed THEN the system SHALL display mock family events, upcoming birthdays, and school runs
2. WHEN the tasks module is accessed THEN the system SHALL show sample chores/tasks with various completion statuses
3. WHEN the messaging module is accessed THEN the system SHALL display mock family messages and posts
4. WHEN the school run tracker is accessed THEN the system SHALL show pickup to drop-off navigation mockups
5. WHEN the settings module is accessed THEN the system SHALL display profile management, notification toggles, and family settings
6. WHEN any module is navigated THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent design and smooth transitions

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user interacting with the prototype, I want to see appropriate feedback and component states, so that the interface feels responsive and complete.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN actions are performed THEN the system SHALL display mock toast notifications for success/failure scenarios
2. WHEN data is loading THEN the system SHALL show loading spinners and appropriate loading states
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL display error placeholders with mock error messages
4. WHEN forms are used THEN the system SHALL show validation states (valid, invalid, pending) with visual feedback
5. WHEN any interactive element is used THEN the system SHALL provide immediate visual feedback

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the prototype to maintain clean, modular architecture, so that backend integration can be added later without major restructuring.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the codebase is reviewed THEN the system SHALL have clear separation between UI components and mock data services
2. WHEN service calls would normally occur THEN the system SHALL use clearly marked mock services and stubs
3. WHEN the code structure is analyzed THEN the system SHALL maintain the existing modular organization (Models, Views, ViewModels, Services)
4. WHEN backend integration is needed later THEN the system SHALL allow easy replacement of mock services with real implementations
5. WHEN the prototype branch is created THEN the system SHALL be completely independent from the main branch's backend dependencies

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a stakeholder, I want the prototype to be production-quality and demo-ready, so that it can be used for presentations and user testing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the prototype is demonstrated THEN the system SHALL have no crashes or broken navigation flows
2. WHEN the visual design is evaluated THEN the system SHALL use consistent fonts, colors, and design elements from the existing brand
3. WHEN the prototype is used THEN the system SHALL feel like a complete, polished application
4. WHEN demonstrations are given THEN the system SHALL work reliably without internet connectivity
5. WHEN the app is tested THEN the system SHALL handle all user interactions gracefully with appropriate feedback
