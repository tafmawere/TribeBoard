## Introduction

The School Run UI feature provides a dedicated SwiftUI screen for managing and visualizing school transportation runs within the TribeBoard family coordination app. This is a UI/UX showcase implementation that focuses on visual design and user interaction patterns without backend integration. The screen enables family members to view trip information, track progress, and communicate during school runs through an intuitive interface.
