# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Meal Plan & Shopping UI Flow is a comprehensive frontend module for the TribeBoard iOS app that enables families to plan meals, check pantry inventory, generate grocery lists, and integrate shopping tasks with family task management. This feature focuses purely on the user interface and navigation flow using placeholder data, without backend connectivity. The module consists of three integrated components: Meal Planning, Grocery & Shopping, and Task Integration, all accessible through a new "HomeLife" navigation tab.
