# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The TribeBoard app is currently crashing on startup due to a ModelContainer initialization failure. The crash occurs because the CloudKit container identifier in the SwiftData configuration doesn't match the app's bundle identifier and CloudKit setup. This feature will fix the crash and ensure proper CloudKit configuration for the app to launch successfully.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the app to launch without crashing, so that I can test and develop the application functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app is launched THEN the system SHALL successfully initialize the ModelContainer without throwing a fatal error
2. WHEN the ModelContainer is created THEN the system SHALL use the correct CloudKit container identifier that matches the app's configuration
3. WHEN CloudKit is unavailable or fails to initialize THEN the system SHALL gracefully fall back to local-only storage without crashing
4. WHEN SwiftData models are invalid THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and attempt fallback initialization

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper CloudKit configuration, so that the app can sync data across devices when CloudKit is available.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app initializes THEN the system SHALL use a CloudKit container identifier that matches the app's bundle identifier format
2. WHEN CloudKit setup fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue with offline functionality
3. WHEN the app runs in the simulator THEN the system SHALL handle CloudKit limitations gracefully without crashing

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want robust error handling during app initialization, so that I can identify and fix configuration issues without app crashes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN ModelContainer creation fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error information in logs
2. WHEN CloudKit configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL fall back to a local-only ModelContainer
3. WHEN running in debug mode THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages for troubleshooting
4. WHEN SwiftData schema validation fails THEN the system SHALL log specific model validation errors

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all SwiftData models to be properly defined, so that the ModelContainer can be created successfully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app initializes THEN all @Model classes SHALL have valid SwiftData annotations and initializers
2. WHEN models are processed by SwiftData THEN they SHALL compile successfully under iOS 17+
3. WHEN duplicate or invalid model declarations exist THEN they SHALL be removed or corrected
4. WHEN model relationships are defined THEN they SHALL use proper @Relationship annotations with correct inverse relationships
